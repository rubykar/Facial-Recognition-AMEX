# Facial-Recognition-AMEX

To enhance security in bank transactions, we aim to implement robust face recognition for user verification. When users transact through the bank application, it is imperative to verify their identity by matching their face with the one linked to their account and then receiving the respective OTP. This measure will significantly strengthen authentication protocols and mitigate the risk of fraudulent activities, ensuring the utmost security and trust in financial transactions.
