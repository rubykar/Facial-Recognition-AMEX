# Facial-Recognition-AMEX

To enhance security in bank transactions, we aim to implement robust face recognition for user verification. When users transact through the bank application, it is imperative to verify their identity by matching their face with the one linked to their account and then receiving the respective OTP. This measure will significantly strengthen authentication protocols and mitigate the risk of fraudulent activities, ensuring the utmost security and trust in financial transactions.

# The Principle of Face Recognition : 
The principles behind face recognition involve using computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify and extract features that are unique to each individual's face, and then comparing those features to a database of known faces to make a match. The accuracy of face recognition depends on several factors, including the quality of the input image, the number and diversity of faces in the database, and the quality and sophistication of the algorithms used for feature extraction and matching.
Several algorithms can be used in this case.
